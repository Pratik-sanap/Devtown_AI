# Image Recognition Bootcamp

A comprehensive image recognition model built as part of a hands-on bootcamp project.  
This notebook demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model capable of classifying images from various datasets.  

## 📌 Overview
This project serves as an end-to-end example of image recognition using deep learning.  
It covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model architecture design
- Training and validation
- Performance evaluation
- Predictions on unseen data

## 🚀 Features
- Supports general image classification tasks.
- Preprocessing pipeline for image normalization and augmentation.
- Configurable model parameters.
- Visualization of training metrics and predictions.
- Easily adaptable for custom datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (>=3.8)
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **OpenCV** (optional, for preprocessing)
